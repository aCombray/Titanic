Thoughts on the project Titanic

How to deal with ordinal features. The cutting into bands of 'Age' and 'Fare' is artificial in my opinion. For an ordinal feature, what people care is just the relative ranking. So the mean, normal distributions etc don't make sense. How to prepossess these features? I feel it is more appropriate to do a clustering of the data. 

What to learn: 
How to study correlations of feature by ploting and visualization. 

Study all the models mentioned. Answer why some are appropriate / some are not appropriate. Can you explain/expect the performance scores?

Leave ensemble methods to the next stage.
